Once the application has started up you can create a `Product` instance using your preferred HTTP client. In the following examples we will be using the https://curl.haxx.se[curl].

To submit a `POST` request use the following in a terminal window:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -i -H "Content-Type:application/json" -X POST localhost:8080/products -d '{"name":"Orange","price":2.0}'

on windows in cmd line the correct way is to do so :
curl -X POST  -d "{\"name\":\"Orange\",\"price\":2.0}" -H "Content-Type:application/json" localhost:8080/products

----

The resulting output will be:

[source,bash]
----
HTTP/1.1 201
X-Application-Context: application:development
Location: http://localhost:8080/products/2
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Date: Wed, 23 Nov 2016 08:46:40 GMT

{"name":"Orange","price":"$2.0"}
----

As you can see an HTTP 201 status code is returned.
